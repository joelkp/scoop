SCOOP: Simple C library for Object-Oriented Programming
-------------------------------------------------------

SCOOP is a Simple C library for Object-Oriented Programming. The aim is for
it to provide lightweight support for object-oriented APIs structured
similarly to those that can be made using C++, without any undue verbosity
and without any needless computational overhead.

The approach is one of providing some simple routines, along with using the
C preprocessor to implement some features and increase the brevity of code
using this library.

Features that are too computationally expensive and/or which increase the
need for verbosity - like multiple inheritance - are purposefully left out.

The core of the library is the Object module, which provides support for:
- Class declaration and definition
- Single inheritance (by direct inclusion of the members of the supertype
  into the subtype)
- Virtual functions
- Explicit RTTI checks

See the header files for the library for further details.
