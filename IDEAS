Brief sketches for possible design extensions:

- Virtual variables - either using the init/reset function, or a static default
  instance to be copied. The latter can be done in the init/reset function,
  which also allows greater flexibility - using functions - and so the latter
  may be best. Virtual variables may be either stored in the vtab (given
  additional information, separating size and number of functions) before (or
  after) the functions, or pointed to by an added pointer. (No other good ideas
  at present.)
- Dynamic subtyping - routine copies the class description and makes the
  original the parent, also marking it as dynamic. Deallocated explicitly.
- Optional instance-tracking - optionally, a type may store the instances, and
  upon explicit deallocation, or "cleaning" for non-dynamic types, the
  instances are destroyed.
